# Lifelong-Learning

Our goal is to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling lifelong learning in RL.

We will experiment with continual / non-stationary RL with world models + planning + context routing.

## Roadmap
1) PPO baseline on MiniGrid (stationary + non-stationary regimes)
2) Single world model + MPC planner baseline
3) Multi-context (multi-head) WM + surprise routing
4) WM adapters + hypernetwork-conditioned modulation (final method)
